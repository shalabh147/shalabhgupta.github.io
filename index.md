My name is Akkapaka Saikiran, and I am a fourth-year undergraduate in Computer Science at [IIT Bombay](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/).
I am interested in machine learning (vision, language, speech) and computer systems (operating systems, networks, architecture).

I'm currently doing my BTech Project (BTP) with Prof. [Preethi Jyothi](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pjyothi/) and Prof. [Ganesh Ramakrishnan](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ganesh/) on self-supervised multimodal learning. I'm also working on a project with Prof. [Mythili Vutukuru](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~mythili/) and Prof. [Biswabandan Panda](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~biswa/) on microarchitectural enhancements for high performance I/O. 


I enjoy reading and writing, but don't do much of it. Yet, you can fine some of my writings [here](https://akkapakasaikiran.github.io/archive.html).
I hope the presence of this site will spur me on to pen some thoughts down.
