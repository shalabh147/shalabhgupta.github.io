My name is Akkapaka Saikiran, and I am a fourth-year undergraduate in Computer Science at [IIT Bombay](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/).
I am interested in machine learning (vision, language, speech) and computer systems (operating systems, networks, architecture).

I'm currently doing my BTech Project (BTP) with Prof. [Preethi Jyothi](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pjyothi/) and Prof. [Ganesh Ramakrishnan](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ganesh/) on self-supervised multimodal learning. I'm also working on a project with Prof. [Mythili Vutukuru](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~mythili/) and Prof. [Biswabandan Panda](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~biswa/) on microarchitectural enhancements for high performance I/O. 
In the summer of 2021, I was a data science intern at Microsoft India, working on vision-language models for Bing Ads classification with [Swati TIwari](https://www.linkedin.com/in/swati-tiwari-1805/) under [Neelesh Khanna](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nekhanna/). The summer before, I was a research intern at ENS Paris-Saclay, exploring Vector Addition Systems, guided by Prof. [Alain Finkel](http://www.lsv.fr/~finkel/). 

You can find some of my writings [here](https://akkapakasaikiran.github.io/archive.html).
I hope the existence of this site will spur me on to pen down my thoughts more.
