Hi, I am Shalabh Gupta, and I am a final year undergraduate in the Computer Science Department at [IIT Bombay](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/).
I am interested in systems (Operating Systems, System Design, Distributed low latency systems) and elements of Deep Learning.

I'm currently working on my BTech Project (BTP) with Prof. [Umesh Bellur](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~umesh/) and Prof. [Purushottam Kulkarni](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~puru) on Dynamic Offloading of host computations onto SmartNICs in Serverless Computing frameworks (FaaS). I have previously worked with Prof. [Suyash Awate](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~suyash/) on Conditional Automatic Image Generation of Diabetic Retinopathy images, and Prof. [Amit Sethi](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~asethi/) on using Graph Convolutional Networks to find spatial relationships in images. 
In the summer of 2021, I was a quantitative developer intern at D.E. Shaw. India, working on analyzing bond fund returns central to the firm's trading and investment strategy, and estimating positioning of those funds against certain market factors like inflation and credit spread. In 2019 winters, I worked as a Data Science Intern at FlexiEle Pvt. Ltd., working on improved extraction and smart identification of resume data for cloud based HR solutions, by building a resume parser.
