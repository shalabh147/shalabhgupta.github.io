This is an essay I wrote for HS 305: Reading Literature, a course I took in my third year at IITB. 
The course had three segments, this is the first assignment of the first segment, which was on Comedy.

### The Problem Statement
Strictly based on readings and the lectures, write a 500 word note on: 'The genre of comedy'.

Readings:
[Michael Silk](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/297175153_The_Greek_dramatic_genres_Theoretical_perspectives),The Greek Dramatic Genres;
[Eli Rozik](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt20q1xvq), The Ritual Origin of Comedy, Chapter 3 of The Roots of Theater

### The Essay

Some of the earliest recorded instances of comedy in the west date back to the 5th century
BCE, when Greek drama was at its zenith. Many works of the time have tragically been lost to
invading hordes but we still possess some of the masterpieces of that golden era. Greek drama
can be broadly divided into three genres: Tragedy, Comedy, and Satyr Plays.

Aristotle's Poetics (c. 350 BCE) is one of the oldest surviving works of literary criticism.
Poetics originally had a volume on Comedy but that has not survived the march of time and we
only have the Tragedy volume now. In Aristotle's view, drama is but an imitation of life, and
comedy itself is "an imitation of characters of a lower type". According to Aristotle, Old
Comedy originates in the phallic processions of the 5th century BCE. He goes on to write that
comedy "was not at first treated seriously" and it was when the comic poet came to be known
as such that the genre was established.

Rozik (2002) puts forth Cornford's theory of the ritual origin of Attic comedy that
complements Murray's theory of the ritual origin of tragedy and is primarily based on
Aristophanes' plays. Aristophanes, a comic playwright (c. 450 BCE), is famous for lampooning
prominent personalities and institutions of his time. His works, with their daring political
commentary and abundance of innuendo, effectively define the genre of Old Comedy today.
Cornford studies Aristophanes' plays by developing a structure which he claims to be the
origins of comedy. However, he faced heavy criticism due to lack of evidence and
generalizability to other texts.

Silk (2013) draws attention to the distinction between text and context. He says (pg 19-21)
"for literary genres, context ... is operative as a socio-cultural reality, generally an institutional
reality" and "by comparison with context, text is open, unspecific, indefinite; even in the
given culture, it calls for interpretation". Context is given to us by history, surrounding works,
and the performance setting, whereas people engaging with the text and forming their own
opinions is the other aspect of it. In the Greek setting, "'context' is the institutional festival(s)
in its (their) theatrical location; 'text' is ... everything else".

What about the nature of comedy? Seidensticker makes an important distinction between
comical/humorous elements ('komische') and elements belonging to the genre of comedy
('Kom√∂dienelemente'). Attic tragedies often did have comical elements and, conversely,
Aristophanes' comedy is not all comical. One recent example of this distinction is when
Stanislavsky, recounting a private reading of Chekov's Three Sisters (1900), says, "'He had
written a ... comedy and all of us had considered the play a tragedy and even wept over it.'"
(Silk, pg 26). So we see classification is not easy, and comedy and tragedy have similar
dramatic structures.

We conclude by saying that theories explaining the origin and nature of comedy are still
widely debated due to the lack of substantial evidence. Nevertheless, the pursuit to try and
understand these theories may be worth the while.

Abstract: *The task of long-form question answering (LFQA) involves retrieving documents relevant to a given question and using them to generate a paragraph-length answer. While many models have recently been proposed for LFQA, we show in this paper that the task formulation raises fundamental challenges regarding evaluation and dataset creation that currently preclude meaningful modeling progress. To demonstrate these challenges, we first design a new system that relies on sparse attention and contrastive retriever learning to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the ELI5 LFQA dataset. While our system tops the public leaderboard, a detailed analysis reveals several troubling trends: (1) our system's generated answers are not actually grounded in the documents that it retrieves; (2) ELI5 contains significant train / test overlap, as at least 81% of ELI5 validation questions occur in paraphrased form in the training set; (3) ROUGE-L is not an informative metric of generated answer quality and can be easily gamed; and (4) human evaluations used for other text generation tasks are unreliable for LFQA. We provide suggestions to mitigate each of these issues, which we hope will lead to more rigorous LFQA research and meaningful progress in the future.*
