This is an essay I wrote for HS 305: Reading Literature, a course I took in my third year at IITB. 
The course had three segments, this is the third assignment of the first segment, which was on Comedy.

### The Problem Statement
Has been lost to time. Best I can remember, it was something along the lines of 'Write a note on the role of comedy in Charandas Chor'. 

Readings:
[Habib Tanvir](https://www.google.co.in/books/edition/_/Sd_8vt2tIZwC?hl=en), Charandas Chor

### The Essay

*Charandas Chor* is a 1975 play by Habib Tanvir based on a Rajasthani folktale by Vijayan
Detha. The protagonist, Charandas, is a thief on the run from the police. He swears before
his guru that he will give up lying. He still carries on with his thievery, claiming it is his means
of livelihood. The story follows his adventures and tribulations as he goes about his
business honestly while upholding four other vows he made for fun. This essay talks about
the role of comedy in the play and how Habib Tanvir addresses societal issues using comic
elements.

*Charandas Chor* is a classic example of folk laughter in drama. It implements
carnivalesque, an idea discussed by Mikhail Bakhtin, which can also be found seen in
Francois Rabelais’ writings. The play is grounded in reality, again something which
characterizes folk comedy according to Bakhtin. The cat-and-mouse chase at the start sets
up the story and loosens up the audience, which was primarily the tired working class. The
play employs simple language coupled with well-defined characters to spin a compelling
tale. Fun is the word that comes to mind when one thinks of *Charandas Chor*, and the
influence of Bertolt Brecht (and his idea of spaß) on Habib Tanvir can be seen here. The play
is constructed as such because the socio-political beliefs of Habib Tanvir were that of
socialism and communism.

The characters of *Charandas Chor* are striking, to say the least, and lend a great deal of
vivacity to the play. The titular character, Charandas is an amiable thief who takes up vows
and stays true to them throughout the play. His character is indeed paradoxical, as Rani
says, "Thieving and truthfulness, what an unheard-of combination" (p. 182). In the rest of the
characters, the play presents caricatures of people in positions of power. The hawaldar is
incompetent and indulges in bribery, the landlord is a selfish tyrant, the munim a corrupt liar,
and the Rani a whimsical two-sided woman who falls for a petty thief. The guru is a peculiar
character, the embodiment of ambivalence in folk laughter, as he means well for his
"disciples" but is money-minded at heart. Overall, the play portrays a critique of the rich and
the royal people.

The inception of the play was in a period of Indian history when the government was a
strong force of power. This forms the socio-political background of *Charandas Chor*. Habib
Tanvir, in the folk setting of the​ *Satnami* community of Chhattisgarh (which is a strong
proponent of truth and equality), raised social issues of growing inequality. He also
expressed a detest of institutions and the "bourgeois", which is reminiscent of Rabelais and
how used burlesque to similar ends. Folk laughter is a great means for this as it welcomes
diversity (the so-called centrifugal force) and strips down the strict rules of respect for
official notions of the sacred.

Thus, *Charandas Chor* manages to deliver a message through comedy and makes for a
convivial entertaining read along the way.
